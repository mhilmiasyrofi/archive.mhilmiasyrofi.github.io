Hey there <img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif' width='25px'>
======
<br>
🧑‍💻 I'm Hilmi, and I love being a data scientist. 📝 [Resume](https://mhilmiasyrofi.github.io/files/Resume.pdf)  📚 [Portfolio](https://mhilmiasyrofi.github.io/portfolio/)

I have a strong analytics and programming background 📈. I published seven papers on Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in reputable international conferences and journals (supervised by [ACM Distinguished Scientist Prof David Lo](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/)). I participated in some Kaggle competitions during my free time. Last year, I won a silver medal 🥈 in a product matching challenge, trying to categorize similar e-commerce products based on their images and product titles.

I grew up chasing grasshoppers in a small rice-farming village in Indonesia 🏞️. Even though I grew up in a small town, I never let that stop me. Throughout junior and senior high school, I achieved prestigious awards in a wide range of academic competitions, including math/statistics and research 🏅🏅🏅.

I'm a high achiever. I'm the first person in my family that earns a degree in engineering and lands an exceptional job in another country 🌏. The ability to acquire new knowledge is my greatest strength. When it comes to trying new things and failing, I'm not afraid to do so. It is impossible for me to be stopped. In order to succeed in both my career and personal life, I put in long hours and go the extra mile.

💼 To deal with complex problems in our world, I love expanding my connection to establish a radical collaboration between inter-disciplinary domains.
