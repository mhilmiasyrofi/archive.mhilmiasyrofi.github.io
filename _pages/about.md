🌱 My journey began in a small rice-farming village in Indonesia, where I nurtured a passion for exploration. Despite my humble origins, I relentlessly pursued excellence, earning numerous awards in mathematics, statistics, and research during my junior and senior high school years 🏅🏅🏅

🏆 As a high achiever, I am the first in my family to earn an engineering degree and secure a remarkable career in the competitive landscape of Singapore 🇸🇬. My thirst for knowledge is insatiable, and I embrace challenges with an unwavering commitment to success. I am not afraid to venture into uncharted territory and learn from my failures.
