Hey there <img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif' width='25px'>
======
<br>
🧑‍💻 I'm Hilmi, a Kaggle Data Science Expert with 4 years of experience delivering high-impact works in the IT industry. Currently, I'm working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [PropertyGuru](https://www.propertyguru.com.sg) Singapore (NSYE: PGRU),  productionizing machine learning projects to generate revenue and to optimize the business.

📝 [Resume](https://mhilmiasyrofi.github.io/files/Resume.pdf)  📚 [Portfolio](https://mhilmiasyrofi.github.io/portfolio/)

I have a strong analytics and programming background 📈. I published seven papers on Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in reputable international conferences and journals (supervised by [ACM Distinguished Scientist Prof David Lo](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/)). I'm a [Kaggle Competitions Expert](https://www.kaggle.com/mhilmiasyrofi/competitions) after winning 2 medals: (1) a silver medal 🥈 in an NLP (Natural Language Processing) + CV (Computer Vision) competition, i.e. recommending similar e-commerce products by analyzing their images and product titles; (2) a bronze medal 🥉 in an NLP competition, i.e. evaluating the language proficiency of essays written by students.

I grew up chasing grasshoppers in a small rice-farming village in Indonesia 🏞️. Even though I grew up in a small town, I never let that stop me. Throughout junior and senior high school, I achieved prestigious awards in a wide range of academic competitions, including mathematics, statistics and research 🏅🏅🏅.

I'm a high achiever. I'm the first person in my family that earns a degree in engineering and lands an exceptional job in the most competitive country in the world 🌏, i.e., Singapore 🇸🇬. The ability to acquire new knowledge is my greatest strength. When it comes to trying new things and failing, I'm not afraid to do so. It is impossible for me to be stopped. In order to succeed in both my career and personal life, I put in long hours and go the extra mile.

💼 To deal with complex problems in our world, I love expanding my connection to establish a radical collaboration between inter-disciplinary domains.
