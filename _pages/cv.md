Experience
======
**Machine Learning Engineer** at [PropertyGuru](https://www.propertyguru.com.sg) - Data Science Center of Excellence, Singapore
  <br> June 2022 - present
  * Developed an Automatic Valuation Model that analyzes historical sales transactions, property characteristics, and price trends to estimate the current market value for a specific property. Contributed to the company's revenue by **productionizing the solution as a sellable system to external clients**, including banks and real estate consultants.
  * Developed an Address Matching system to synchronize a physical location with address records in the data warehouse. Leveraged advance natural language processing techniques to **aggregate data from multiple sources to provide rich information from an address**, e.g. property information, property valuation, and property risk assessment. Improved the matching rate by more than 70% compared to the legacy SQL-based string matching.
  * **Led cross-team collaboration** with data engineers and software engineers to solve inaccurate address listings in Malaysia. Fixed 150k inaccurate listing data, resulting in more accurate location-based listing recommendations and an estimated six-month revenue increase of over USD100k.
  * **Led an initiative to incorporate Trustworthy metrics** in the machine learning systems. Detected and performed root cause analysis on unacceptable fluctuating predictions in a highly critical product. As a result, the volatile predictions were reduced by more than 90%.

**AI Research Engineer** at [SCIS SMU](https://scis.smu.edu.sg/), Singapore
  <br> Nov 2019 - May 2022
  * Conducted research on Trustworthy AI supervised by ACM Distinguished Scientist Prof David Lo.
  * Published 7 papers in international conferences and journals, i.e., IEEE TSE (Q1, CCF Rank A, Impact Factor: 6.11),  ACM ESEC/FSE (CORE A*), IEEE ICSME (CORE A), and IEEE SANER (CORE A).
  * Experienced in maintaining various TensorFlow and PyTorch machine learning projects using Docker running on Nvidia DGX Station AI Supercomputer.

**Co-Founder & CTO** at [Alinamed](https://alinamed.com/), Indonesia
  <br> Jan 2019 - July 2020
  * Managed the end-to-end software development lifecycle by collaborating across members to evolve SDLC, including functional requirements analysis, design specification, technical code review, project planning, and implementation of applications
  * Managed the selection of programming languages, frameworks, cloud, web servers, databases, and mobile apps
  * Won prestigious startup competitions, e.g., [1st Winner at WMM by Bank Mandiri](http://news.unair.ac.id/en/2020/12/02/unair-alumnis-startup-alinamed-wins-first-place-in-2020-wmm/), 1st Winner at Startup Weekend Surabaya, Winner at Tech-to-Impact by UK-ID Tech Hub. Secured IDR 750 million investment from Telkom Indonesia.

**Machine Learning Engineer** at [Bukalapak](https://www.bukalapak.com/), Indonesia
  <br> May 2018 - Aug 2018 (Internship)
  * Developed object detection as a part of the "search by image" feature. It’s implemented using Faster RCNN on Tensorflow
  * Developed character recognition to detect seller's information (e.g., phone number and Instagram username) in the e-commerce product image. Localized text lines using CTPN (Connectionist Text Proposal Network). Implemented post-processing techniques on OpenCV to combine several words within the same context.

Honors and Awards
======
* 2022 \| **Bronze Medal - Top 7% (170 from 2,654)** \| Evaluating Written Essays \| NLP + CV \| [Kaggle Leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shopee-product-matching/leaderboard)
  <br> The challenge was to assess the language proficiency of students by analyzing their written essays. I leveraged DeBERTa language models to extract the feature embeddings from the essays. Then, I trained neural network layers to predict the proficiency scores from extracted features
* 2021 \| **Silver Medal - Top 5% (101 from 2,426)** \| Shopee Product Matching \| NLP + CV \| [Kaggle Leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shopee-product-matching/leaderboard)
  <br> The task was predicting similar e-commerce products by using product images and titles. I utilized EfficientNet and NFNet to extract feature embeddings from images and utilized BERT and TFIDF to extract feature embeddings from texts. I calculated the cosine distance between products and employed k-NN to find similar products
* 2021 \|	**Top 3% (28 from 1,034)** \| Information Extraction - Shopee Data Science Challenge  \| NLP \| [Kaggle Leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/scl-2021-ds/leaderboard)
  <br> The challenge was extracting Point of Interest (POI) names and street names from unformatted Indonesia addresses collected by Shopee. I framed the challenge as NER (Named Entity Recognition), where POI and street are the extracted entities. Then, I fine-tuned the IndoNLU model on the customized dataset.
* 2019 \|	Gojek Upscale 02 for Indonesia's Data Science Enthusiast \| [Certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18t8Cq0Epnf9T5pFpeuNNQWMxRf9d0LdX/view?usp=sharing)
  <br> A complete two-day experience from the Gojek data science team. It covered machine learning, data modeling, and Gojek data science practices. I was one of 20 chosen participants out of 1,000 applicants
* 2019	\| Southeast Asia Machine Learning School (SEA MLS)
  <br> A five-day ML training event held by [Southeast Asia’s AI experts](https://www.sea-mls.com/organizers) working at DeepMind UK and Google Brain USA. I was one of 200 chosen participants out of 1200 applicants across Southeast Asia and India
* 2017  \| **1<sup>st</sup> Winner** \| Competition on Building Device for Visually Impaired People \| [Documentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cz_4ubMjVVpU7vGgRYCTnbbQUd-nSRl6/view)
  <br> Developed a device for visually impaired people to help them hear what they see. It’s powered by a RaspberryPI as a processing unit. It captured an image using a camera, recognized texts and then output voices
* 2011	\| **Bronze Medal** \| Mathematics Olympiad at 2nd National Science Camp \| [Certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CLFcdlM1zQRmPmOGZg-SfBqkjaIzQqNE/view?usp=sharing)
  <br> Awarded by Ministry of Education - Indonesia
